# Verified GitHub releases

Pushing an exact semantic-version tag such as `v0.1.0` runs the release
workflow only when that tag’s commit is already reachable from `main`. Cut
releases from merged `main`, not from a feature branch. The workflow tests the
tagged source, builds `darwin/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, and
`linux/amd64` archives, publishes them with `checksums.txt`, and attaches a
keyless Cosign signature and bundle for that checksum manifest. Every archive
contains the `tailapp` binary, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE`. The workflow also
creates GitHub build-provenance attestations for every archive.

Download the archive matching your operating system and CPU together with
`checksums.txt`, `checksums.txt.sig`, and `checksums.txt.bundle` from the same
GitHub release. Verify the signature before trusting the checksums:

```sh
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle checksums.txt.bundle \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/generalbusiness-ai/tailapps/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v[0-9].*$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  checksums.txt
sha256sum --check checksums.txt
```

On macOS, replace the last command with `shasum -a 256 ARCHIVE` and compare its
digest to the matching line in `checksums.txt` when `sha256sum` is unavailable.
The signed checksum manifest covers the exact archive bytes. Then extract the
archive and use the included `tailapp` binary.

For an independent GitHub-hosted provenance check, use GitHub CLI:

```sh
gh attestation verify ARCHIVE --repo generalbusiness-ai/tailapps
```

The release workflow receives its signing identity from GitHub Actions OIDC;
it uses no long-lived signing key or repository secret. It is intentionally
triggered only by a tag push, not by a pull request or a branch build.
